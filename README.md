This is the app created by me which I designed in reference from https://dribbble.com/shots/17409666-Investkan-Investment-Bank-Mobile-App

There are two pages in this app:
- Home Page
- Second Page

There are different components which I used to create this app like:
- Flat List
- Pressable
- Activity Indicator
- Modals
- React Navigator

Its functionalities are:
- On clicking 'Get Started', it takes us to Second Page which is possible all because of React navigator
- Under the heading list Portfilo there is a list present which is scrollable
- On clicking 'Best Buys' a modal comes up which shows the best buy and it can be closed using the close button present in it

Various screenshots are:
- Home Page
- Second Page
- Scrolling in List Portfolio
- Best Buys Modal
